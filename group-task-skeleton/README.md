# üó∫Ô∏è Wroclaw Public Transport Finder - Group Project Skeleton

This repository provides a starting skeleton for the **Group Task** of the **Prompt Engineering course**. Its goal is to help your team quickly set up and begin development on the Wroclaw Public Transport Finder application.

## üöÄ About This Skeleton

This skeleton offers a foundational structure, including:

* A basic **Python backend** utilizing:
    * **Flask** for the REST API.
    * **SQLite3** for the database.
* A minimal **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend**.
* An initial setup designed to allow **testing of API connectivity end-to-end** (e.g., the backend might return mocked/minimal data, and the frontend might display the raw JSON response).

Your primary objective will be to build upon this skeleton, implementing the full set of features, UI elements, and backend logic as detailed in the main exercise description.
